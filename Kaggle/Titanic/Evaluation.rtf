\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'. \'a0For the training set, we provide the outcome ( 'ground truth' ) for each passenger. \'a0You will use this set to build your model to generate predictions for the test set.\
For each passenger in the test set, you must predict whether or not they survived the sinking ( 0 for deceased, 1 for survived ). \'a0Your score is the percentage of passengers you correctly predict.\

\outl0\strokewidth0 \'a0The Kaggle leaderboard has a public and private component. \'a050% of your predictions for the test set have been randomly assigned to the public leaderboard ( the same 50% for all users ). \'a0Your score on this public portion is what will appear on the leaderboard. \'a0At the end of the contest, we will reveal your score on the private 50% of the data, which will determine the final winner. \'a0This method prevents users from 'overfitting' to the leaderboard.\
